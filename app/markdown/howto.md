1. Calculate your angular resolution in degrees-per-millimeter by dividing the physical width of your screen in millimeters by your in-game field of view.
1. Choose a weapon loadout from the ones you entered above. Load into a game of Plunder (custom multiplayer works for MW weapons) with the exact same loadout.
1. Find or mark a spot on a flat, blank wall. Stand close enough that bullet impacts are visible without having to zoom (10-20 meters works well). Shoot while controlling the recoil to the best of your ability.
1. Return to hip-fire view and measure the width of your recoil spread on your screen in millimeters. Multiply this by your angular resolution. This is your horizontal spread in degrees. On PC, you can lower your FOV to the minimum value (60 degrees) to make it easier to measure, as long as you divide by this FOV in step 1.
1. Similarly, measure the on-screen height of your recoil spread and again multiply by your angular resolution to find your vertical recoil spread.
1. For robustness, repeat a few times and calculate an average for each dimension. A spreadsheet can save you plenty of time (see an [example here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dI-sTLOfQm0vV1yiuDNP5jWPgeHfEwaoFi5Kw4FOi64/edit?usp=sharing)).
1. Repeat steps 3-6 for each weapon loadout in your data set.
